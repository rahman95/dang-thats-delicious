## Now That's Delicious!

Together we will build "Now That's Delicious!", a full stack restaurant application which users can search, geolocate, review and curate their favourite restaurants from around the world.

The application has three main models — Users, Stores and Reviews — all of which are relational. It is designed to hit upon many of today's application needs such as user authentication, database storage, Ajax REST API, file upload and image resizing.
